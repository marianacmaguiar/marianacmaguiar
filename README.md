I'm a physics teacher and a data scientist who loves open source programs and tools. I have master's degree in natural science period during which I developed my research using Python for data analysis and data processing.

Since then, I have studied and, more recently, worked with python, data science and machine learning algorithms focused in business solutions. For more details about my projects and each solution, they are described in the data science project section.
